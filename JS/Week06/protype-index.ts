/**
 * The prototype is an object that is associated with every function and object by default in JavaScript.
 * Whenever a function is created in JavaScript, JavaScript engine adds a prototype property inside a function,
 * which is an object. This prototype property is shared among all the instances of the constructor function.
 * It allows you to add properties and methods to an object, which can be shared across all instances of that object.
